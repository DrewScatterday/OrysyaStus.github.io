Currently, I work as a Data Scientist at [Seismic Software](https://seismic.com/) where I use data to identify shared assets in content, develop meaningful recommendations, create customer-facing insights, and apply various data science applications. In June 2018, I finished my Masters in Data Science and Engineering from the University of California, San Diego. During my Masters, I worked full-time as a Data Scientist, competed and won 4 separate [hackathons](https://orysyastus.github.io//projects/), and was a [Data Science for Social Good Fellow at the University of Washington](https://escience.washington.edu/dssg/). Before I was a Data Scientist, I was a Bioengineer, graduating my Bachelors in Bioengineering from the University of California, San Diego in June 2016 and working on research involving [synthetic biology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHCbkR0uYs8&t=4s), [regenerative medicine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29405961), and [cancer](https://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/77/13_Supplement/1208.short). 

I love working on projects and research, constantly learning, and challenging myself. In my free time, I am embroidering, dancing, rock climbing, and traveling.
